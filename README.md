# Manuscripts Handbook and Notes

## What's Manuscripts?

Manuscripts is a free (and public domain) book format for Markdown.
Basically just a bunch of text files (in markdown) plus a `book.yml` (for the book info e.g. title, author, edition, year, etc.)
and `contents.yml` (for table of contents and the file structure) file.

## Text

Any text files using the markdown formatting style in any order in any folder structure you please.


## Images

Any images in any folder structure you please.

Note: For a single-page book everything gets merged into a single page (hence, the name ;-) and for your images in your build
you have three options:

1. All images get copied along into the "top-level" folder of the single-page book   - or -
2. All images get copied along into a single `/i`, `/images` or `/your-name-here`  (sub) folder  - or -
3. All images get base64 encoded (ascii-fied) and inlined and embedded into the single-page book.



## License

The Manuscripts format and conventions are dedicated to the public domain.
Use it as you please with no restrictions whatsoever.
